# Tasks

#### 1. Help us out and fill out the [survey](http://bit.ly/RTS1409)

> It's anonymous

#### 2. There can be only one expanded contact at a time

> **Hint** the `Context` value can also contain functions.

#### 3. Fetch a list of contacts from external source

> **Hint** either use the [randomuser.me](randomuser.me) service.

> **Hint** use the [`fetch` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) to create the HTTP request for contacts.

> **Hint** use the `seed` option to get the same response with each request.

#### 4. :star: Create a dark theme for your app and a widget to change the theme

> **Hint** the widget can be as simple as a `select` dropdown.

#### 5. :fire: Simulate querying and sorting on the server

> **Hint** The API doesn't support querying or sorting, but this can be simulated on client side

> **Hint** Create a `requestContacts` function that takes query and sort, and returns a list of contacts

> **Hint** remember to cleanup pending requests if user keeps typing

#### 6. :fire: When filtering highlight the searched phrase in each contact

#### 7. :fire: It was all about Pokemon

> Use the [Pokemon TCG API](https://pokemontcg.io/) and replace contacts with Pokemon
